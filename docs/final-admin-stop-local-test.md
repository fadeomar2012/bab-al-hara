# Bab Al Hara — Admin Stop Summary & Local QA

## What changed in this final stop

### Admin dashboard
- Reworked the admin home page into an operational dashboard.
- Added priority cards for:
  - pending orders
  - orders waiting for delivery fee confirmation
  - low stock variants
  - out of stock variants
- Added today summary:
  - today's orders
  - today's pending orders
  - today's order value
- Added recent orders list with status, delivery status, total, location, and contact details.
- Added stock alerts list for variants below their low-stock threshold.
- Kept the layout mobile-first and action-oriented.

### Optional WhatsApp number
- Added optional WhatsApp number to checkout.
- The field is only used when the WhatsApp number differs from the main phone number.
- Stored on the order as a snapshot so admins can see it per order.
- Stored on the customer record when provided.
- Displayed in:

## Database change

Prisma schema now includes:

```prisma
model Customer {
  whatsappPhone String?
}

model Order {
  customerWhatsappPhone String?
  @@index([customerWhatsappPhone])
}
```

## Local commands after merging

For dev/demo database:

```bash
npm run db:generate
npm run db:push
npm run db:backfill-delivery-fee-status
npm run db:backfill-inventory-ledger
npm run db:backfill-sold-count
npm run db:audit-commerce
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run dev
```

For migration workflow instead of db:push:

```bash
npm run db:migrate -- --name add_whatsapp_phone_and_admin_dashboard
npm run db:backfill-delivery-fee-status
npm run db:backfill-inventory-ledger
npm run db:backfill-sold-count
npm run db:audit-commerce
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run dev
```
